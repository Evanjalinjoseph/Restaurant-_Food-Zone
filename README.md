#  Project Insight
The dashboard uncovered that lunch hours on weekends see the highest customer volume but also a dip in satisfaction due to longer wait times. Signature dishes like “Spicy Thai Noodles” and “Grilled Mediterranean Platter” consistently perform well in both sales and reviews. Items with low order volume but high preparation time were marked for review. Reservation trends suggested a strong preference for early-week dinner bookings, prompting marketing campaigns to target slower periods.

# Conclusion
The restaurant dashboard transforms operational data into strategic insight, supporting decisions that improve customer experience, staff efficiency, and menu optimization. With a clear view of what drives satisfaction and revenue, the restaurant is positioned to continuously enhance service, streamline operations, and solidify its reputation as a destination for culinary excellence.
